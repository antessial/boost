This repository's sole purpose is to keep the track of my story in which I am diving into a mad world of Boost. 
Perhaps I will close this repo one day, but maybe I will not. We'll see. But as for now, this library seems like fun.
First few code fragments won't be too complex, I want them to be useful in case I forget a thing or two.
And there's hope that my code might actually help someone else.. Who knows?
